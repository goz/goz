These days I do a lot of vibe-coding, review carefully (aka stare at diffs for 67 minutes while praying the AI didn’t hallucinate), then spend 67% of my life debugging edge cases.

I grew up on the north coast of Java, back when [OM PMR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4QuTuMUxhY) ruled the radio and everyone knew the lyrics.
