# Hey, I’m Goz 👋🏽

These days I do a lot of vibe-coding, ~review carefully~ stare at diffs for 30 minutes ~and praying the AI didn’t hallucinate~, then spend 67% of my days debugging edge cases.

I grew up on the north coast of Java, back when [OM PMR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4QuTuMUxhY) ruled the radio and everyone knew the lyrics.
