# Hi there, I'm goz 👋

I'm a Software Engineer—mostly writing code, sometimes breaking things, and always learning. I’d call my skills “average at best,” but I believe showing up and building is what counts most.

- 🛠️ **Top Skill:** I know enough to get by
- 🌐 **LinkedIn:** [in/goz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/goz)
