# Hi there, I'm Goz 👋

I help keep large-scale systems steady and users free from downtime and hidden misery. Today I’m at Apple, with past roles at Meta and Visa, and earlier years building across Indonesia and Singapore. Still learning to make technology feel effortless for the people who use it.
