# Hi there, I'm Goz 👋

I write software — sometimes elegantly, sometimes experimentally. Most days things run smoothly; on the others, I learn, adjust, and keep going.
Right now, I build resilient services at Apple.
In a past life, I made it through Meta’s engineering bootcamp and worked on payments at Visa.
